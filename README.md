# kubernetes

The purpose of this repository is to keep a history of Kubernetes technical examples. The intention is to create individual examples that are easy to understand and keep them simple. Each example contains the minimum lines of code to demonstrate the functionality.

There are only two layers of complexity:

* The examples comply with OpenShift security requirements.
* The examples comply with OpenShift Service Mesh.
