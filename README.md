# kubernetes

Kubernetes and OpenShift made easy.

## Getting Started

The purpose of this repository is to keep a history of Kubernetes technical examples. The intention is to create individual examples that are easy to understand and keep them simple. Each example contains the minimum lines of code to demonstrate the functionality.

Some of the examples add an extra layer of complexity because of Istio and OpenShift Service Mesh, but many of those Kubernetes objects can be ignored.
